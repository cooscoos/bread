# Cold fermentation

An alternative to acheiving good flavour without biga (which is quite hard to control) is cold fermentation.

In cold fermentation:

- use cold water (8 deg C or the same temperature as your fridge) during mixing
- the amount of yeast is reduced from 2% to 1%, and;
- the yeast is allowed to multiply for 24 to 48 hours during bulk fermentation.

Try 24 hours first and see how it goes.

The final proofing time may double (or at least increase) as it takes time to warm up after being out of the fridge.

Try 1:

- Used 10 deg C water
- 1% yeast
- 24 hour bulk fermenation

The bulk fermenation was long enough but even with double proofing time, final proofing was lackluster - it was possibly still underproofed. Next time, let the bread warm up for a couple of hours on the counter before shaping?
