## Sprouting spelt

50 g of dry spelt will yield about 78 g of sprouted grains.

1. Soak 50 g spelt for 12 hours
1. Drain, rinse, then leave in strainer covered for 8-12 hours
1. Continue to rinse and stir every 8-12 hours until small white sprout emerges (may take 36 hours from first soak)

At this point either:
- dehydrate and grind into flour
- freeze
- blitz into a dough
- pat dry and use as whole spelt

## First attempt (whole spelt)

Abreaducation recipes suggest using 13 &ndash; 25 bakers % of sprouted spelt in a wholegrain recipe.

They do not adjust the % of water in the recipe. If you wanted to you could measure the sprouted graints and subtract the dry weight to find the grams of water being added and subract this from the free water? See how much it is.

For 900 g beginners wholegrain loaf 13 %ndash; 25 % is equivalent to:

$497 \times (13 - 25)\% = 64.6 - 124.3 g$

For 600 g loaf it's:

$332 \times 13 - 25)\% = 43.2 - 83 g$
