# Biga

- 100 g flour, 75 g water, 0.7 g yeast
- Mix and leave for one day to ferment
- Make a bread, reducing quantities of flour, water in line with above

This results in a lot more rise because the yeast multiply within the biga. Unfortunately, the amount the yeast multiplies is going to depend on factors that are hard to control, like the amount of available sugar and the temperature of the kitchen.

The yeast in the final loaf should therefore be reduced to compensate for the extra yeast in the biga, but how much? Nobody really knows.

Using biga is inconsistent. Try cold fermentation instead.
