## Ingredients (whole-wheat)

> :warning: **Not yet tested**: This is experimental.

Ingredients for 50/50 have a higher water content compared to white loaf. The [dough calculator](./dough_calc.ipynb) assumes this water-content scales linearly and can be used to create recipes for any percentage of whole-wheat flour.

Here is the output for 100% whole-wheat.

## Steps

As per [white loaf](./beginner_white_loaf.md) with a few tweaks because whole-wheat doughs:

- ferment faster
- are less elastic

So:

1. reduce bulk ferment time if ready before 1 hr
2. be gentler during final shaping
3. reduce final proof time, don't rely as heavily on size changes as an indicator of readiness.
